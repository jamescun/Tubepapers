## Installation

Tubepapers is just a series of hardcoded static files. However, the project takes advantage of [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) to automate running of scss and various linters.

Initally, you'll need to run `bundle install` initially to grab Ruby dependancies.

From then on use `bundle exec guard` to start Guard and watch for changes.
